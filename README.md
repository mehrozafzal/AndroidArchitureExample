# AndroidDevelopmentTest
Public repository for Seattle Information System Development Task. 
This is a SEARCH user and find user DETAILS module for android using GIT API.
I have implemented FRAGMENT NAVIGATION PATTERN and SINGLETON CLASS PATTERN in this project.
There is mechanism for viewing history for user. It is maintained by using Shared Preference storage.
Furthermore for the networking library I have used RETROFIT.
Everything is custom designed.
This project has been published for only 1 time so I have not made any commits.
